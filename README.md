# 100DayOfCodeReboot - A Challenge to Write some Code for 100 Days
100 Days of Code - Restart this effort and try to be more organized and strategic with it.

I created this project to help me stay fresh with programming - using techniques and languages I don't get to use with my daily job responsibilities.

I first got the idea of 100 Days of Code from [PyBites 100 Days of Code Challenge](https://github.com/pybites/100DaysOfCode).
While the PyBites version is designed for 100 consecutive days, my own 100 days here will be 100 individual days, though not consecutive.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

TBD

### Installing

Get a copy of the 100DaysOfCode repository.
